ENERGY USAGE ANALYTICS FOR CONSUMPTION CONTROL

Project Description

This project addresses the critical issue of rising peak energy demand during the month of July—a time when higher temperatures significantly strain regional power grids. Our team developed a comprehensive data science solution that analyzes energy consumption patterns in conjunction with weather trends and housing characteristics.

Through predictive modeling, we aim to support utility providers and policymakers in proactively managing energy distribution and mitigating grid overload. This work was completed as part of the IST687 - *Introduction to Data Science* course.

## 🔍 Data Analysis Approach

The analysis pipeline included:

1. **Data Cleaning & Merging**: Integrated datasets on hourly energy consumption, temperature records, and static housing data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identified consumption trends, temperature impact patterns, and geographic usage differences.
3. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - **Linear Regression**
   - **Decision Trees**

These models were trained to forecast energy demand under both current and simulated future climate conditions (e.g., +5°C temperature rise), providing a risk-aware energy planning framework.

## 📊 Key Features of the Shiny Application

📈 Time Series Visualization: Displays daily and hourly fluctuations in energy usage to reveal peak consumption periods and seasonal trends.

🔍 Scatterplot Matrix with Correlation Insights: Enables multi-variable analysis of energy usage with key weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation.

🌡️ Climate Sensitivity Analysis: Highlights how environmental factors like temperature and humidity influence consumption patterns, guiding energy conservation strategies.
